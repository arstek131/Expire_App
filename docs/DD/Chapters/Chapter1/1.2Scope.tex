\section{Scope}
As stated in the RASD document, the aim of the DREAM software product is to develop and adopt anticipatory governance models for food systems to strengthen data-driven statepolicy. It takes care of the acquisition and management of all data collected in order to support the work of farmers, agronomists and policy makers. The system aims to collect data not only from sensors located throughout the territory, but also from farmers. The analysis of the acquired data aims to improve the production of farmers. Low-performing farmers are identified by policy makers and helped by the best-performing ones. Everything is supervised by agronomists who take care of their own geographical areas of competence.
