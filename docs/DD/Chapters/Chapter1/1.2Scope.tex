\section{Scope}
It often happens that after you've been to the grocery store, you put products in the fridge, in the cupboard, etc. And forget about it, until they expires. Expire App has mainly been developed for users who want to track the expiration date of the products. It also allows to create a shared list of products with members of the same household. If you're running out of ideas, and want to avoid waste, Expire App allows you to find recipes with the products you have on hand and it also allows users to view the nutritional information of foods. The architecture must be designed to be maintainable and extensible, while the individual components must have high cohesion and decoupling. For this purpose, the various components must not incorporate several unrelated functionalities and should decrease interdependency between them. Furthermore, design patterns and architectural styles will be used for the same reason.
