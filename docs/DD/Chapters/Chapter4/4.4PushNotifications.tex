\section{Push notifications}
In our application, having push notifications is fundamental not only to remind the user that some food is expiring on the fridge but also to help communication and interactions among users belonging to the same family group. Each notification is delivered directly to all the users belonging to the same family when one of the four following actions take place:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] A user joins your family
    \item[--] A user adds a product
    \item[--] A user adds a shopping list
    \item[--] There are some products expiring in the current day
\end{itemize}
