\subsection{Home screen}
The homepage is designed to display all the products of a user (if he/she has any), or the products also from other family members if he/she belongs to a family group.
The screen also displays some useful information about the product, for example the expiration date.
There is also the possibility to add new products, by pressing the "+" button, adding them by using barcode or by simply adding them by name.
In addition, by pressing on a product, present in the product list, there is the possibility to view detailed information about that product, such as nutritional values, ingredients, etc.
