\subsection{Implementation}
Push notifications are centralized on Google and Apple servers for security reasons. For this reason, our application makes use of the \textbf{Firebase cloud messaging} service. This allows us to avoid implementing communication towards APNs which is all handled by Firebase making the notification service almost completely transparent to the developer.

\noindent Each physical device is registered to a 'topic' which corresponds to the family id and a topic name is essentially an identifier for a pool of observers waiting for possible notifications.
\newline\newline
\noindent To sent notifications programmatically, we made use of \textit{Firebase functions}. We attached three different listeners on new additions on shopping lists, products and users. There is also a scheduled function programmed to run each day at 7a.m. and inform users is a product is expiring that day (Crontab notation).
