\subsection{User Info Screen}
The user info screen is the last that users can access through the tab selector. It shows the profile image of the user at the top, with his/her nickname and email. Below the screen is divided in two main subsections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Account: it contains two buttons, "change name" and "delete account", that gives to the users the possibility to change their display name and delete their account.
    \item Family: this subsection manage the synchronization with family members, and contains 4 buttons: "share family" that give to the users the possibility to generate a qr code and give to the other users the possibility to join their family; "leave family", once pressed, pop up an alert dialogue to ask users if they really want to leave the family group (whether they're a part of it); "family members" open a new screen and shows the list of users of a family; "join family" pop up a dialog where users have the possibility to join a family group by scanning a qr code or inserting manually the id of a family group.
\end{itemize}
