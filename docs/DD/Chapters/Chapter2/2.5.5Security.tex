\subsection{Security}
Attacks against a system can compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system or its data. System security includes the development and implementation of security countermeasures.
Some security measures are adopted in the code, for example the use of information hiding techniques (usage of private classes, creation of proper getters and setters methods, etc.).
On the server side, some Firebase security rules are exploited, these rules are hosted on Firebase servers and are applied automatically at all times and administrator can change the rules of the database in Firebase console.
