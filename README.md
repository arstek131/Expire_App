Final project for the DIMA (Design And Implementation Of Mobile Applications) course at Politecnico di Milano.

## Brief Description
Expire App has been developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The main purpose of the app, is to track, as the name suggests, the expiration date of the food you buy, by sending reminders. 

The real potential of Expire app is the ability to share your product list with other family members.
But you actually can do much more, for instance you can keep track of your healthy diet, or find personalized recipes or even create shopping lists shared with other family members.
Last but not least, itâ€™s important to remember that
Expire App is available for both users, online and offline.
